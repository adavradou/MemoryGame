# MemoryGame
A memory game created using Windows Forms.
The player has the option to select between 3 different datasets (Mario, Crash Bandicoot or Pokemon), before starting the game. The respective soundtrack will start playing on the background.

When the game starts, the cards are visible for 5 seconds, and then they turn around and become non-visible.

When the game ends, a pop-up window shows statistics, such as attempts and time needed.

The card covers and soundtracks can be found inside the Resources folder. However, the Crash Bandicoot soundtrack could not be uploaded.
